# GitHub

You have full access to GitHub using the `gh` CLI. Make sure `gh auth status` shows authenticated.

## Issues

```bash
# List issues
gh issue list -R OWNER/REPO --limit 10
gh issue list -R OWNER/REPO --state closed --label "bug"

# View issue details
gh issue view NUMBER -R OWNER/REPO

# Create issue
gh issue create -R OWNER/REPO --title "TITLE" --body "BODY" --label "bug" --assignee "@me"

# Close issue
gh issue close NUMBER -R OWNER/REPO

# Comment on issue
gh issue comment NUMBER -R OWNER/REPO --body "Comment text"

# Structured output
gh issue list -R OWNER/REPO --json number,title,state,labels,assignees | jq '.'
```

## Pull Requests

```bash
# List PRs
gh pr list -R OWNER/REPO --limit 10
gh pr list -R OWNER/REPO --state merged

# View PR details
gh pr view NUMBER -R OWNER/REPO

# View diff
gh pr diff NUMBER -R OWNER/REPO

# Check CI status
gh pr checks NUMBER -R OWNER/REPO

# Merge PR (squash, merge, or rebase)
gh pr merge NUMBER -R OWNER/REPO --squash --delete-branch

# Create PR
gh pr create -R OWNER/REPO --title "TITLE" --body "BODY" --base main
```

## CI / GitHub Actions

```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list -R OWNER/REPO --limit 5
gh run list -R OWNER/REPO --workflow "ci.yml"

# View run details and logs
gh run view RUN_ID -R OWNER/REPO
gh run view RUN_ID -R OWNER/REPO --log-failed

# Re-run a failed workflow
gh run rerun RUN_ID -R OWNER/REPO --failed
```

## Releases

```bash
# List releases
gh release list -R OWNER/REPO --limit 5

# View latest release
gh release view --latest -R OWNER/REPO

# Create release
gh release create TAG -R OWNER/REPO --title "TITLE" --notes "Release notes" --generate-notes

# Upload assets to release
gh release upload TAG ./file.zip -R OWNER/REPO
```

## Search & API

```bash
# Search repos
gh search repos "QUERY" --limit 10

# Search code
gh search code "QUERY" -R OWNER/REPO --limit 10

# Raw API call (for anything not covered)
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/commits --paginate | jq '.[0:5] | .[].commit.message'
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/contributors | jq '.[] | {login, contributions}'
```

## Repo management

```bash
# Clone, fork
gh repo clone OWNER/REPO
gh repo fork OWNER/REPO

# View repo info
gh repo view OWNER/REPO

# Create repo
gh repo create NAME --public --description "DESC" --clone
```

## Tips

- Always use `-R OWNER/REPO` to target the correct repository.
- Use `--json` flag for structured output, then filter with `jq`.
- Use `--limit` to cap results and avoid overwhelming output.
- Check `gh auth status` if you get permission errors.
- For large diffs, use `gh pr diff NUMBER | head -100`.
